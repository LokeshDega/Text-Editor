# Text-Editor

This is a simple HTML text editor application that allows users to select different font families, font weights and toggle italic style. It also provides options to reset the editor and save the content locally using localStorage and the content is auto saved locally.

# Run Application

To run this application four files are necessary index.html, styles.css, script,js, punt-frontend-assignment.json files. All the four files should be in the same directory.

# Improvements 

Adding different font sizes and font styles would have made the application more user friendly to use.
